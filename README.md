- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Download](https://takeout.google.com) Google Fit history (only select Fit -> Activities)
- Create a folder called "data", rename the takeout zip file into "dataset" and move it there
- Rename ".env.example" into ".env", add a mapbox token if you want to see the map
- Open a terminal in this folder and run `docker compose up --build`
- Wait for all the containers to load. This might take a while, especially with a large dataset
- After all the containers have loaded, open http://localhost:3000/ to visualize your Google Fit history
